These is the start of a set of unit tests for PocketSOAP

These use COMUnit v1.1.1 available from
http://comunit.sourceforge.net/

Requirements

1.  	COMUnit 1.1.1 	http://comunit.sourceforge.net/
1. 	PocketSOAP (duh!)
2. 	A proxy server that supports SSL (I use Mindreefs SOAPScope and sometime Squid)
3. 	MSXML4.0 Installed (I use SP2)
4.  	IIS installed and running the pocketSOAP server tests. Doesn't have to be on the local machine


Configuring the test server
A number of tests make HTTP requests to a test server, here's how to configure the test server
1. 	You'll need IIS with ASP installed and running,  
2. 	To run the SSL tests you'll need IIS configuring for SSL and you'll need to make sure your test client machine
   	has the server cert installed (if you're using internal/test certificates)
3. 	You'll need 4s4c (www.pocketsoap.com/4s4c/) installed.
4.	create a virtual directory in IIS that maps to the unitTests-com\server directory, 
	You can name this vdir anything, but the default in the tests is /ps-tests
	make sure the directory is configured for anon access as well as having basic authentication enabled
5.	register the interop servivce typelibrary with regtlb interoplab.tlb
6.  	register the interop.dll using regsvr32 interop.dll
7.  	check 4s4c is running ok by pulling up the service description page http://servername/ps-tests/echo.asp
 

Build & Run the tests
Open the COMUnitTemplates.vbp project and open the modCommon.bas file, and alter the following consts as required
	TEST_SERVER_HTTP
	TEST_SERVER_HTTPS
	HTTP_AUTH_USER
	HTTP_AUTH_PWD
	PROXY_SERVER
	PROXY_PORT
	PROXY_AUTH_USER
	PROXY_AUTH_PWD

You should be able to build and run the tests at this point using the GUI test framework.
