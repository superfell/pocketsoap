You'll Need

1) DocGen, unfortuanly this requires Gen<X> which was a comercial product from Developmentor, they stopped selling/supporting it, there was talk of open sourcing it, but nothing has materialized so far.
2) SED, the standard unix SED utility ported to windows
3) The HTML Help Workshop see http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/vsconwhatis.asp
4) a lot of paitence and some good luck!.
