<h1>DocGen</h1>
<h2>(a.k.a. &quot;IDL + XML = HTML + Happiness&quot;)</h2>
<h3><i>by Shawn VanNess</i></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>The DocGen Wizard allows you to generate reference docs for your object models -- it &quot;weaves&quot; 
together API documentation (provided in an XML file) with API elements defined in the IDL file, 
to produce a folder full of HTML files.</p>
<p>In addition to raw HTML files, the DocGen Wizard also produces the table-of-contents, index, 
and project files needed by the Microsoft HTML Help Workshop compiler. &nbsp;All that is left 
to do is run hhc.exe!</p>
<p>If documentation is missing for one or more API elements, a warning message is displayed, 
and placeholder text is used in its stead. &nbsp;The DocGen Wizard also provides an option 
to automatically &quot;stub-out&quot; the XML file with placeholder text for the missing docs.</p>
<p>The DocGen Wizard will really come into its own when adapted for the next release of Gen&lt;X&gt;, 
which supports the notion of &quot;faceless exemplars&quot;. &nbsp;Wizards like DocGen will 
become first-class build tools, which can be run from the command-line, and, therefore, be 
integrated into automated build processes!</p>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>This version of DocGen requires <a href="http://www.develop.com/genx/">Gen&lt;X&gt; v1.0</a>, 
  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting/">Windows Script 5.0</a>, and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/">MSXML 
  v1.0</a>.</li>
  <li>The next release of Gen&lt;X&gt; will support true &quot;silent&quot; operation, so wizards 
  like DocGen can be incorporated into automated build-scripts. &nbsp;Such wizards are being 
  called &quot;faceless exemplars&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
DocGen is a stand-alone wizard, which means that it can be run from within the Gen&lt;X&gt; 
Wizard Manager or from the command line. To run it from within the Wizard Manager, double-click 
on <b>DocGenWizard.gxw</b> and press the &quot;Run Wizard&quot; button on the toolbar. To run 
DocGen from the command line, use the wizrun command line tool, e.g. 
<ul>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre>WizRun.exe DocGenWizard.gxw</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</ul>
<h3>Usage (Advanced):</h3>
<p>To create an XML &quot;skeleton&quot;, for a brand new IDL file, simply check the &quot;auto-generate 
placeholder text&quot; checkbox. &nbsp;If the specified .xml file does not exist, it will be 
created for you.</p>
<h3>Known Limitations and Bugs:</h3>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>If DocGen finds a previously-unencountered interface (or a hidden interface) referenced 
  inside of a coclass definition, then a scripting error will occur.</li>
</ul>
