<h1>PocketSOAP Versions</h1>

PocketSOAP is available in two major versions, a Win32 build that runs on the vast majority of Win32 platforms, 
and a pocketPC build that runs on pocketPC devices [aka WinCE].

Will not run. This is because pocketSOAP uses a locale aware API for type conversions that was
introduced with OSR2. <a href="mailto:sf@zaks.demon.co.uk?subject=Win95 support for pocketSOAP">Let me know</a> 
if this is a serious issue, and i'll look into changing this.
